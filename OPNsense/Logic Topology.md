Oracle(OPNSense) has a tunnel site-to-site to Home-lab(OPNSense), since Home-Lab ip address is dynamic he is the initiator always, and OPNSense sitting at cloud only waits for the connection

Wireguard is used to close a tunnel between personal devices and my lan allowing myself access to resources and encrypted navigation since all traffic was set to be routed through opnsense
